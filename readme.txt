This project is very simple to execute, as it does not contain many source files. First, compile the files

[userid@machine Assignment3Rasterizer]$ make

This will make create a binary file called rasterizer. Execute the file:

[userid@machine Assignment3Rasterizer]$ ./rasterizer

This will create all the ppm files: abg.ppm, halfplane.ppm, triangle.ppm, rgb.ppm, texture.ppm.
The binary will also print to the console the lat/long coordinates of the building, as well as the building name for part f).
